Hello! My name is Evan, and I am a Forest Carbon Analyst at the Pacific Forestry Centre with Natural Resources Canada.

Currently, I am working on generating remote sensing based yield curves for the entirety of the forested area of Canada, and using those to provide stable estimates of carbon across the country.

I recently completed my PhD, where I focused on how we can use satellite products such as forest structure and productivity metrics to assess protected area effectiveness and ecological integrity across British Columbia.

My broader research interests are big data processing, and how we can use satellite imagery to assess biodiversity from space. I am hugely interested in reproducible science, and typically use R (and Quarto) in my day to day work, although I do dabble in Python and would love to learn Julia, if I ever find the time.

Outside of work, I am a (incredibly) amateur birder and enjoy powerlifting, running, and playing recreational soccer. I spend a lot of my free time hiking and backpacking, and also enjoy playing video games.
