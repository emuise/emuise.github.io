Hello! My name is Evan, and I am a PhD candidate at the Integrated Remote Sensing Studio at the University of British Columbia.

I currently research how we can use satellite products such as forest structure and productivity metrics to assess protected area effectiveness and ecological integrity. At the moment, I am working on assessing the impact of the human footprint on ecological integrity across Vancouver Island.

My broader research interests are big data processing, and how we can use satellite imagery to assess biodiversity from space. I am hugely interested in reproducible science, and typically use R (and Quarto) in my day to day work, although I do dabble in Python and would love to learn Julia, if I ever find the time.

Outside of work, I am an amateur birder and enjoy powerlifting, running, and playing recreational soccer. I spend a lot of my free time hiking and backpacking, and also enjoy playing video games.

Evan
